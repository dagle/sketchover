- Optimize the rendering
- An optional ui
  - A palett
  - A toolbox
  - A size tool
- make it possible to escape/run a program

- Add support for mousepointers [when next way of smithway 0.18 is released]

- Being able to create screenshots [when sithway add support for the screencopy protocol]
-- Not mainly as a screenshot tool (but it makes it easier rather competing with another program) and all the code will be there anyways.
-- Use a screenshot to "freeze" the frame, then render the screenshot as a "background"

- Why do we just get a black screen on pause?
