- Optimize the rendering
- An optional ui
  - A palett
  - A toolbox
  - A size tool
- make it possible to escape/run a program

- Add support for mousepointers [when next way of smithway 0.18 is released]

- Fix leaving draw mode

- Create a text tool?
-- How to type without triggering keybindings? Ignore keybindings until esc is pressed?

- Draw Alt mode, draws with the alt color.

- Being able to set things to specific values instead of relative.
-- SetColor, SetTool

- Add integer values to nextcolor, prevcolor, nexttool, prevtool (2t => next tool twice)

- Make it possible to bind thing to the mouse wheel.

- Fix names for mouse buttons. Hard coding mouse button 272 is bad.

- Fix scale factor

- update_output, is this if we change the resolution? What should we do or should we just 
  expect the user to rerun?

- When pausing the colors get stronger, doing a partial rendering would fix this
