Core:
- [x] Draw should take a style, so we can specify the style and update it.

- [ ] output should have an api easier to work with, atm callbacks are useless?
-- [x] we want to be able identify the screen
-- [?] we want to be able to get an "handle" from an id
-- [?] we want to be able to save a screen.
- we want to be able to control if it's a drawing area?

Runtime:
- [?] Make it possible to bind thing to the mouse wheel.
-- Descrete scrolling not done

- When pausing the colors get stronger, doing a partial rendering would fix this

- Fix scale factor and rotation for outputs, we need to detect if the
  screen needs scaling etc

Plugins: 
- [ ] Get a working plugin and an example plugin to work.

- [-] Being able to highligt, we need to send dt and draw in draw() and not
  return a pb, to be able to fill.

- Create a text tool?
-- How to type without triggering keybindings? Ignore keybindings until esc is pressed?
  (this needs to be in core)
