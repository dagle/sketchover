- Optimize the rendering
- An optional ui
  - A palett
  - A toolbox
  - A size tool
- make it possible to escape/run a program

- [x] Add support for mousepointers [when next way of smithway 0.18 is released]

- [-] Add a setfg/unsetfg/togglefg? function that sets the foreground
- [-] Being able to highligt, we need to send dt and draw in draw() and not
  return a pb, to be able to fill.

- Fix leaving draw mode

- Create a text tool?
-- How to type without triggering keybindings? Ignore keybindings until esc is pressed?

  expect the user to rerun?

- When pausing the colors get stronger, doing a partial rendering would fix this

// should be be moved to the tools and we should have an draw current_draw_args.
pub struct Draw {
    pub style: StrokeStyle,
    pub color: raqote::SolidSource,
    pub distance: bool,
    pub tool: Tool,
}

- [ ] Make each tool take modes that you can send to them.
  -- [ ] How to make it less annoying to implement shift sending a mode for different keys
